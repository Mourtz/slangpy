### Implementation Overview: Structs and Classes

This implementation can be broken down into three main phases:

#### **Phase 1: Basic System**

The core idea is to introduce two new Python types: `Module` and `Struct`.

- **Module**: This is a wrapper around the SGL (Slang Graphics Library) module. It provides an easy way to access structs and global functions from the module.
  
- **Struct**: This represents a Slang struct (not an instance of the struct). Essentially, it encapsulates a set of functions, including a constructor, that can be called explicitly by passing in a `this` parameter.

This approach allows for calling member functions in their simplest form, making it useful for straightforward cases. For example, if you have a structured buffer of Slang particles, this system allows you to construct each particle in the buffer and then call methods on them. The objects can also be mutable if stored in a writable container such as writable structured buffer.

#### **Phase 2: Pure Slang Instances**

The next step is to introduce "pure Slang" instances, which are Python objects that handle the `this` parameter internally but aren't extended by the user. The process looks like this:

1. **Create an Instance**: You can create an instance by calling something like `slangpy.Instance(module, struct)`.
   
2. **Set Up the `This` Field**: This could be a buffer or a dictionary of nested fieldsâ€”essentially, it represents the instance's data.

3. **Call the Constructor**: If needed, you can explicitly call the constructor to initialize the instance.

4. **Call Other Functions**: Once initialized, you can invoke any other functions as needed.

This can be further enhanced with syntactic sugar to simplify usage. For example, you could call the struct type directly to create and return an instance, or use attribute accessors for members of the `this` field. At its core though, it simply stores the `this` parameter and automatically passes it into functions.

#### **Phase 3: Extended or 'Bound' Instances**

The final phase involves creating extended or "bound" instances, which inherit from pure Slang instances. The key additions are:

- **Custom Python Functions**: Users can add their own Python methods alongside the existing Slang function calls.
  
- **Syntactic Sugar Enhancements**: Further simplifications can be made to improve the mapping between Python and Slang, potentially making it easier for IDEs to assist with autocompletion or type inference.

- **Overriding storage** The ``This`` field can actually be accessed by slangpy with `get_this` and `update_this` calls. As a result, advanced use cases can completely override how data is stored internally.
